This code is the simplest implementation of gain and loss rates of binding sites. There is only one pair of parameters. The same code samples data and learns. We are currently hard-coding this.

Usage:
./estimateRate data/blen_hog1spec.txt data/inputmapping.txt data/species_prob_osr6spec.txt samples_1_3.txt 2 3
